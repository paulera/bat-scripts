BAT files that I use in my Windows environments, to make life easier

<hr>
#####[pingog.bat : check internet connection] (https://github.com/paulera/bat-scripts/blob/master/pingog.bat)
Ping the address www.google.com to check the internet connection (assuming that Google server never goes down).
<hr>
#####[backup_dump.bat : backup a database in a password protected zip file] (https://github.com/paulera/bat-scripts/blob/master/backup_dump.bat)
I made this script as a quick way to get snapshots of my local databases. It uses the mysqldump command to generate a database dump and compress it as a password protected zip file.

When commiting code, I usually commit the database snapshot generated by this script as well.
